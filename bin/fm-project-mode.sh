# Resolve a project's delivery mode and yolo flag from the data/projects.md registry.
# Prints two words to stdout: "<mode> <yolo>" where mode is one of
# no-mistakes|direct-PR|local-only and yolo is on|off.
#
# Registry line format (data/projects.md):
#   - <name> - <desc> (added <date>)                  -> no-mistakes off  (legacy default)
#   - <name> [<mode>] - <desc> (added <date>)          -> <mode> off
#   - <name> [<mode> +yolo] - <desc> (added <date>)    -> <mode> on
#
# mode = how a finished change reaches main:
#   no-mistakes  full pipeline -> PR -> captain merge (default)
#   direct-PR    push + PR via gh-axi, no pipeline -> captain merge
#   local-only   local branch, no remote/PR -> captain approve -> guarded local merge
#   no-mistakes-prod-only
#                a conditional policy for a remote-backed project rather than one
#                flat mode: genuinely internal-only tooling, automation,
#                contributor or operator process, and release or submission work
#                ships direct-PR, while product-facing, mixed, and uncertain work
#                ships no-mistakes. It resolves per task, never per project, so
#                this script reports the policy itself and bin/fm-task-delivery.sh
#                turns it into one task's concrete mode from firstmate's explicit
#                surface classification. Project-scoped consumers (fleet sync,
#                secondmate seeding, no-mistakes initialization) treat it as the
#                remote-backed, pipeline-capable project it is.
# yolo (orthogonal) = when on, firstmate may make routine approval decisions itself.
#   AGENTS.md section 7 is the single owner of authority exceptions, including
#   ask-user contract expansion and stronger captain boundaries.
#
# An unknown/missing project or unknown mode falls back to "no-mistakes off" and warns
# to stderr, so a typo never silently drops the gate.
# A line with no bracket is the legacy "no-mistakes off" entry and keeps that meaning
# forever: this parser never migrates or reinterprets an existing record. The
# project-management skill owns intake, where a NEWLY added or created remote-backed
# project is registered "[no-mistakes-prod-only]" unless the captain names another
# policy, a project with no remote is registered "[local-only]", and "+yolo" is added
# only on an explicit standing or current captain instruction.
# Usage: fm-project-mode.sh <project-name>
