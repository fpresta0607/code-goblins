# tests/fm-watch-arm.test.sh - the arm layer's cycle-close contract when the arm
# did not own the cycle.
#
# The watcher prints its one reason line to its OWN stdout, so only the arm that
# forked it ever reads that line. An arm that ATTACHED to an existing cycle holds
# no handle on it and can observe only a released lock, which is why a completely
# successful cycle used to be reported as
# "watcher: FAILED - cycle ended without an actionable reason" on every harness
# whose protocol reads that line. These are real-process tests: a real
# bin/fm-watch.sh holds the singleton, a real bin/fm-watch-arm.sh attaches to it,
# and a real status change drives a real wake through the watcher-bound delivery
# record and durable queue.
