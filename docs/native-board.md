# Native supervisor and board

`cfo serve` runs one native Go supervisor and serves the embedded React/TypeScript board on `http://127.0.0.1:4310`.
Use `--listen 127.0.0.1:0` for an ephemeral port; the command prints its actual URL.
Node, Vite, Docker, and a browser are not runtime dependencies of the supervisor.
Docker remains an optional project environment managed by the existing worktree profiles.

The service takes the existing `.watch.lock` before opening recovery state.
An existing watcher must finish before `serve` can acquire that singleton; starting the board never kills a watcher or worker.
Closing the browser disconnects a view, while Ctrl-C in the supervisor terminal stops that process.
Restarting with the same CFO home recovers durable events, evaluations, actions, and lineage.

## Native hook setup

Run `cfo hooks check claude`, `cfo hooks check codex`, or `cfo hooks check pi` to inspect the installed capability contract.
Run `cfo hooks install <harness>` to add the corresponding native lifecycle integration.
The verified minimum contracts are Claude Code 2.1.278, Codex 0.154.0, and Pi 0.85.1.
Kimi remains supported by existing CFO runtime monitoring; this change does not claim Kimi native lifecycle hooks.

Default destinations are `~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.codex/hooks.json`, and `~/.pi/agent/extensions/cfo-native.ts`.
Use `--config-dir <absolute-directory>` for a custom harness home or an isolated test configuration.
Setup preserves unrelated JSON hooks/settings, takes a first backup before changing existing JSON, and replaces only its owned helper.
It does not change models, gate policy, approval settings, or Codex hook trust.
Review the exact installed Codex definitions in `/hooks` before they can run.

Claude and Codex helpers pipe hook stdin to `cfo native-hook <harness>` using bounded PowerShell commands.
Pi's extension calls the same executable directly from its native event handlers.
Hooks record identity and lifecycle metadata, not prompts, tool arguments, or transcripts.
They atomically spool an event and return without Git, network, gate, or browser work.
The installer records the absolute executable/home/state paths, so reinstall the owned helper after moving the executable.

| Harness signal | Native meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Claude/Codex SessionStart | Session started |
| UserPromptSubmit / PostToolUse | Activity evidence |
| Stop | Settled; requests task evaluation |
| SessionEnd | Harness session ended |
| Codex Interrupt | Interrupted; requests evaluation |
| SubagentStart / SubagentStop | Reported child started / settled |
| Pi session_start / agent_start / tool_execution_end | Started / active |
| Pi agent_settled with no pending messages | Settled after continuations and retries |
| Pi session_shutdown | Session ended |

Distinct hook invocations receive distinct durable IDs, including two Stops within one native turn after a hook-requested continuation.
Replaying the same spool record retains its ID and is idempotent.
A Stop never establishes that the task shipped.

## Evidence and recovery

The supervisor reuses the existing monitor, watch signal signatures, wake queue, task metadata, Herdr steering, and frozen pipeline reader.
One Windows filesystem watcher consumes the spool, with a two-second recovery interval for missed notifications.
One slow reconciliation pass runs each minute; there is no browser-driven task polling engine.
Unresolved tasks continue reconciling after SessionEnd, after becoming ready, and after their native session is retired.
Verified terminal tasks leave that polling path until new session activity supplies a reason to reevaluate.

Fresh, matching Herdr monitor evidence distinguishes a working harness from an unavailable or stale one.
An abrupt process crash does not change the recorded native event into an invented end event.
The board shows runtime unavailability separately and continues evaluating independent task/gate evidence.
Silence, a vanished process, a Stop, and a prior `notify --done` are never substitutes for delivery evidence.

Review, tests, lint, documentation, push, PR, and CI must agree with the task's exact HEAD under its frozen policy.
Unrecovered pipeline custody blocks feedback even if a run is failed or cancelled.
The browser can request evaluation or send contextual feedback through verified Herdr delivery; it cannot approve gates, drag a task to done, merge, or execute arbitrary shell commands.

For a ship task, a merged PR remains **merged-awaiting-verification** until the supervisor verifies landed main content.
It checks repository identity, current remote default-branch HEAD, matching locally available main objects, and the contents or absence of every task-changed file on main, then rechecks the remote head.
Missing local objects produce an explicit verification-pending reason; the supervisor does not fetch or modify the worktree to hide missing evidence.
The pipeline's `terminal_head_verified_at` proves its terminal worktree head, not that the task's content was read on main.
Manual task modes retain their existing review/delivery authority and are not automatically marked done by native hooks.

Full-task diffs use a retained, validated project merge base when available, otherwise an established `origin/HEAD` merge base.
If neither is available, preview reports that limitation instead of substituting `HEAD^` and omitting earlier task commits.
Individual commit previews are separate, explicit views.

## Persistence bounds

The active store retains up to 512 session nodes, 512 retired-parent markers, 512 tracked tasks/evaluations, 256 actions, and 2,048 recently seen event IDs.
The serialized store is limited to 8 MiB and recent malformed-event diagnostics to 20 entries.
Ended sessions or sessions inactive for seven days can roll out when they have no pending action.
Needed unresolved task references survive session retirement, and missing parents remain explicitly retired or unreported.
Task admission may replace terminal history; 512 unresolved tasks or 512 recent sessions deliberately apply backpressure rather than silently dropping ownership.

The inbox admits 4,096 small records, each at most 64 KiB.
Ingestion sorts its bounded read window by event time before its 256-record consumption batch, retries records awaiting start/metadata evidence, and rotates the window if concurrent writers briefly exceed admission capacity.
Transient persistence failures retain the inbox record and roll memory back to the last durable state.
Malformed records leave a bounded diagnostic and do not wedge subsequent valid work.
An interrupted evaluation is safe to replay; an interrupted feedback delivery becomes uncertain and is not resent automatically.
Uncertain actions remain visible for operator inspection and can eventually exhaust action capacity if left unresolved.

## Board and orchestration

The header switches between Board and Orchestration, with one main view visible at a time and one contextual pane on the right.
Board groups actual tasks into Tasks, In progress and Completed; only verified delivery enters Completed.
Active cards open their native terminal, while selecting a completed card opens Changes, including when that same task completed after selection.
The default pane shows the registered CFO's native output and submitted messages.
Needs attention discloses unresolved decisions without acknowledging or hiding them.
Task-semantic goblin avatars are presentation choices, not inferred native role evidence.

Orchestration nodes use explicit native parent/root IDs and the launch environment's reported relationships.
Directory names and temporal proximity never establish parentage.
Replayed, stale, reparenting, or cyclic input cannot silently change the tree.
Unknown and retired parents remain visible, and task dependencies are rendered separately from spawned/delegated links.
Unreported child models remain unreported even when their owning task declares a model and effort.
Dragging a card or using Alt plus an arrow key changes only its saved browser position; connectors retain their reported parent identity.
The canvas starts at no less than 80% scale, with scroll/pan for extra roots; explicit Fit can zoom further out.
Arrange resets positions, and storage failures remain visible.
Narrow screens use a collapsible nested list that names the actual parent when indentation is capped.
A child without its own reported native transport explains that limitation and links its owning task without borrowing that task's terminal or model.
Communication pulses last at most ten seconds and require a recent successful targeted worker instruction, matching task identity, and a connected stream.

Changes presents stacked file disclosures with lazy syntax-highlighted unified, split and code previews.
Select a visible old/new line or contiguous range, including unchanged context, and Send to CFO queues a durable review record containing the exact file, side, range, revision, HEAD and diff fingerprint.
The server validates those coordinates and derives the selected code; it never sends a review comment to the worker.
Review remains available during gate custody, while actual worker steering retains the custody checks.
Drafts bind the task session identity at selection and survive view, file and recipient changes without silently moving to a restarted task.
An unchanged submitted payload keeps its request ID after an ambiguous HTTP failure; an SSE outcome is displayed instead of dispatching it again.
An interrupted external delivery becomes uncertain and is not replayed automatically.

The installed Herdr schema supports native terminal capture and verified submitted messages, not a browser PTY attachment.
Each capture is limited to 120 lines / 64 KiB and eight seconds, with one shared in-flight slot across CFO and worker requests.
The visible pane requests its next capture five seconds after the previous request finishes and stops while hidden or disconnected.
Captured output preserves native newlines; replies are not generated or simulated by the board.
Full cursor, keyboard and Ctrl+C emulation remains in the existing native Herdr tab.

CFO transport reads the operator-owned `state/primary.json` registration and binds each queued message to its fingerprint.
On Windows it holds that registration against replacement during delivery and validates the live process/start time, foreground process group, registered agent, pane, workspace and tab before using a required-agent sender.
Missing or changed identity is refused, never passed to the explicit-pane shell fallback.
Herdr acceptance counters establish accepted delivery; the current native contract cannot prove a model response or provide an atomic process-identity compare-and-send operation.

## Local endpoint boundaries

The listener requires a numeric loopback address.
Host and Origin checks, cross-site rejection, a per-instance mutation token, strict request schemas, and bounded request bodies protect the local control API.
These are local browser boundaries, not authentication against another process already running as the same Windows user.
Git previews refuse unsafe revisions, traversal, symlinks/junctions, and common credential-bearing paths.
Git output, timeouts, cache entries, concurrent previews, and event streams are bounded.
Terminal capture applies the existing bounded redaction patterns; operators should still avoid putting secrets into terminal output.

## Build and verification

Use Node 24.13.0 and the committed npm lockfile when editing the board:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
cd ..
go build -o cfo.exe ./cmd/cfo
```

Vite generates `internal/boardweb/dist`; do not edit that output manually.
Commit the regenerated assets with frontend source changes.
Both Windows CI and release workflows install from the lockfile, check the frontend, regenerate assets, and fail if the committed bundle differs before compiling Go.
The runtime executable embeds those assets and requires no Node process.
For frontend development, `npm run dev` listens at `127.0.0.1:5173` and proxies API calls to a supervisor on `127.0.0.1:4310`, translating only that explicit local development origin.

Before any test step invokes `cfo` or `go test`, clear `CFO_HOME` and `CFO_STATE_OVERRIDE` or point both to an isolated temporary home.
For bounded local checks, use `GOMAXPROCS=2`, `go vet -p 1 ./...`, and `go test -p 1 ./...`.
The opt-in `tests/acceptance/native_board_windows.ps1 -Binary <absolute-built-executable> -HarnessBinary <absolute-harness-executable>` requires `CFO_BOARD_REAL=1` and creates an isolated home, git project, named Herdr session, native CFO and worker processes, hooks, and board.
Build the harness from `./tests/fixtures/native-board-harness` with the basename `codex.exe`.
Validate/scan both supplied executables before running them when required by machine security policy; copying or rebuilding a flagged binary is not clearance.
The fixture's disposable `codex.exe` is a deterministic test process, not Codex and not a model invocation; its basename exercises Herdr's real foreground-process contract.
Only the recorded fixture PIDs/session may be stopped during crash checks.
The fixture uses `serve --example`, allowed only with a temporary CFO home and its own state directory.
That mode labels Example workspace and omits the production machine-wide orphan inventory, which otherwise sees unrelated host processes beside the isolated Herdr session.
It retains task monitoring and custody checks and never clears shared decisions or stops shared processes.
See [the implementation evidence](evidence/cfo-native-board.md) for measured overhead, browser results, and the unresolved earlier Defender detections.

## Source provenance

Native contracts were checked against installed versions and the primary [Codex hooks](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/hooks), [Claude Code hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks), and [Pi extensions](https://pi.dev/docs/latest/extensions) documentation.
The pinned [Cline Kanban source](https://github.com/cline/kanban/tree/abd4912c27ce6b7f18b5a8106c145fd838e90cc4) supplied adapted board, diff, history, and runtime-stream behavior.
Its Apache-2.0 license, copyright, file links, and modification notes are retained in `frontend/public/assets/NOTICE.txt` and the bundled license files; no upstream NOTICE file was present at that revision.
SIQshift's shared brand stylesheet, desktop/web controls, and shared ShiftGroups supplied inspected card/ghost/focus, native-select and disclosure primitives.
The user-approved generated mockups supplied the final dark/mint two-view composition, large system typography and terminal-goblin artwork.
The supplied code/workflow references informed review and lineage presentation without adding a graph dependency or an automation editor.
