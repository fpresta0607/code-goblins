# Native supervisor and board

`cfo serve` runs one native Go supervisor and serves the embedded React/TypeScript board on `http://127.0.0.1:4310`.
Use `--listen 127.0.0.1:0` for an ephemeral port; the command prints its actual URL.
Node, Vite, Docker, and a browser are not runtime dependencies of the supervisor.
Docker remains an optional project environment managed by the existing worktree profiles.

The service takes the existing `.watch.lock` before opening recovery state.
An existing watcher must finish before `serve` can acquire that singleton; starting the board never kills a watcher or worker.
Closing the browser disconnects a view, while Ctrl-C in the supervisor terminal stops that process.
Restarting with the same CFO home recovers durable events, evaluations, actions, and lineage.

## Native hook setup

Run `cfo hooks check claude`, `cfo hooks check codex`, or `cfo hooks check pi` to inspect the installed capability contract.
Run `cfo hooks install <harness>` to add the corresponding native lifecycle integration.
The verified minimum contracts are Claude Code 2.1.278, Codex 0.154.0, and Pi 0.85.1.
Kimi remains supported by existing CFO runtime monitoring; this change does not claim Kimi native lifecycle hooks.

Default destinations are `~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.codex/hooks.json`, and `~/.pi/agent/extensions/cfo-native.ts`.
Use `--config-dir <absolute-directory>` for a custom harness home or an isolated test configuration.
Setup preserves unrelated JSON hooks/settings, takes a first backup before changing existing JSON, and replaces only its owned helper.
It does not change models, gate policy, approval settings, or Codex hook trust.
Review the exact installed Codex definitions in `/hooks` before they can run.

Claude and Codex helpers pipe hook stdin to `cfo native-hook <harness>` using bounded PowerShell commands.
Pi's extension calls the same executable directly from its native event handlers.
Hooks record identity and lifecycle metadata, not prompts, tool arguments, or transcripts.
They atomically spool an event and return without Git, network, gate, or browser work.
The installer records the absolute executable/home/state paths, so reinstall the owned helper after moving the executable.

| Harness signal | Native meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Claude/Codex SessionStart | Session started |
| UserPromptSubmit / PostToolUse | Activity evidence |
| Stop | Settled; requests task evaluation |
| SessionEnd | Harness session ended |
| Codex Interrupt | Interrupted; requests evaluation |
| SubagentStart / SubagentStop | Reported child started / settled |
| Pi session_start / agent_start / tool_execution_end | Started / active |
| Pi agent_settled with no pending messages | Settled after continuations and retries |
| Pi session_shutdown | Session ended |

Distinct hook invocations receive distinct durable IDs, including two Stops within one native turn after a hook-requested continuation.
Replaying the same spool record retains its ID and is idempotent.
A Stop never establishes that the task shipped.

## Evidence and recovery

The supervisor reuses the existing monitor, watch signal signatures, wake queue, task metadata, Herdr steering, and frozen pipeline reader.
One Windows filesystem watcher consumes the spool, with a two-second recovery interval for missed notifications.
One slow reconciliation pass runs each minute; there is no browser-driven task polling engine.
Unresolved tasks continue reconciling after SessionEnd, after becoming ready, and after their native session is retired.
Verified terminal tasks leave that polling path until new session activity supplies a reason to reevaluate.

Fresh, matching Herdr monitor evidence distinguishes a working harness from an unavailable or stale one.
An abrupt process crash does not change the recorded native event into an invented end event.
The board shows runtime unavailability separately and continues evaluating independent task/gate evidence.
Silence, a vanished process, a Stop, and a prior `notify --done` are never substitutes for delivery evidence.

Review, tests, lint, documentation, push, PR, and CI must agree with the task's exact HEAD under its frozen policy.
Unrecovered pipeline custody blocks native worker terminal input even if a run is failed or cancelled.
The browser can request evaluation or send contextual review comments to the verified CFO; it cannot approve gates, drag a task to done, or merge.
An explicitly connected terminal sends ordinary terminal input to that existing session, subject to the identity and custody boundaries below.

For a ship task, a merged PR remains **merged-awaiting-verification** until the supervisor verifies landed main content.
It checks repository identity, current remote default-branch HEAD, matching locally available main objects, and the contents or absence of every task-changed file on main, then rechecks the remote head.
Missing local objects produce an explicit verification-pending reason; the supervisor does not fetch or modify the worktree to hide missing evidence.
The pipeline's `terminal_head_verified_at` proves its terminal worktree head, not that the task's content was read on main.
Manual task modes retain their existing review/delivery authority and are not automatically marked done by native hooks.

Full-task diffs use a retained, validated project merge base when available, otherwise an established `origin/HEAD` merge base.
If neither is available, preview reports that limitation instead of substituting `HEAD^` and omitting earlier task commits.
Individual commit previews are separate, explicit views.

## Persistence bounds

The active store retains up to 512 session nodes, 512 retired-parent markers, 512 tracked tasks/evaluations, 256 actions, and 2,048 recently seen event IDs.
The serialized store is limited to 8 MiB and recent malformed-event diagnostics to 20 entries.
Ended sessions or sessions inactive for seven days can roll out when they have no pending action.
Needed unresolved task references survive session retirement, and missing parents remain explicitly retired or unreported.
Task admission may replace terminal history; 512 unresolved tasks or 512 recent sessions deliberately apply backpressure rather than silently dropping ownership.

The inbox admits 4,096 small records, each at most 64 KiB.
Ingestion sorts its bounded read window by event time before its 256-record consumption batch, retries records awaiting start/metadata evidence, and rotates the window if concurrent writers briefly exceed admission capacity.
Transient persistence failures retain the inbox record and roll memory back to the last durable state.
Malformed records leave a bounded diagnostic and do not wedge subsequent valid work.
An interrupted evaluation is safe to replay; an interrupted external delivery becomes uncertain and is not resent automatically.
Uncertain actions remain visible for operator inspection and can eventually exhaust action capacity if left unresolved.

## Board and orchestration

The header switches between Board and Orchestration, with one main view visible at a time and one contextual pane on the right.
Board groups actual tasks into Tasks, In progress and Completed; only verified delivery enters Completed.
Every Board card opens its changes, activity and commit history; Board has no terminal or standalone message composer.
Orchestration opens the selected native terminal and defaults to the registered CFO.
Cards show their reported project name, and the spacious contextual panel provides repository, branch and working-folder context on one continuous surface.
Open in VS Code and Open folder require a deliberate click and resolve the selected goblin's fresh, isolated Git worktree.
The API accepts task identity and an editor enum, never a browser-provided path or command; it starts Code.exe directly with literal arguments and removes Electron Node/development flags from its inherited environment.
Successful launch means the application was requested, not that a window was observed.
Queued tasks show their known project and Not started yet, without querying nonexistent task metadata.
Operational wake records remain intact; only explicitly escalated CFO questions open a modal.
Task-semantic goblin avatars are presentation choices, not inferred native role evidence.

Orchestration nodes use explicit native parent/root IDs and the launch environment's reported relationships.
Directory names and temporal proximity never establish parentage.
Replayed, stale, reparenting, or cyclic input cannot silently change the tree.
Unknown and retired parents remain visible, and task dependencies are rendered separately from spawned/delegated links.
Unreported child models remain unreported even when their owning task declares a model and effort.
Dragging a card or using Alt plus an arrow key changes only its saved browser position; connectors retain their reported parent identity.
The canvas starts at no less than 80% scale, with scroll/pan for extra roots; explicit Fit can zoom further out.
Arrange resets positions, and storage failures remain visible.
Narrow screens use a collapsible nested list that names the actual parent when indentation is capped.
A child without its own reported native transport explains that limitation without borrowing its owning task's terminal or model.
Bounded accepted-message receipts produce a brief travelling connector pulse and receiving-card glow where exact caller native identity proves the reported parent.
Native-creation receipts instead produce a quiet birth highlight on that proven parent branch plus the child-card glow and entrance; creation is never rendered as a message receipt.
The caller convention is `CFO_SESSION_ID` plus `CFO_SESSION_HARNESS`, with native `CODEX_THREAD_ID` fallback; same-harness or directory/time resemblance never establishes a sender.
When sender identity is unavailable, only target evidence is shown.
Each effect expires independently; initial load, reconnect, hidden-tab return, instance replacement and replayed receipts never fabricate new activity.
Reduced motion uses a short static outline instead of movement.

Changes presents stacked file disclosures with lazy syntax-highlighted unified, split and code previews.
Select a visible old/new line or contiguous range, including unchanged context, and Send to CFO queues a durable review record containing the exact file, side, range, revision, HEAD and diff fingerprint.
The server validates those coordinates and derives bounded selected code; it never sends a review comment to the worker.
Admission separately pins the registered primary CFO fingerprint; retries preserve it even if the primary changes.
New annotations use only the verified CFO normal native message channel, and success requires transport acceptance.
They do not append a second actionable wake record; existing historical wake records remain untouched and old unpinned reviews are not adopted or replayed.
Review remains available during gate custody, while native worker terminal input retains the custody checks.
Drafts bind the task session identity at selection and survive view, file and recipient changes without silently moving to a restarted task.
An unchanged submitted payload keeps its request ID after an ambiguous HTTP failure; an SSE outcome is displayed instead of dispatching it again.
An interrupted external delivery becomes uncertain and is not replayed automatically.

The installed Herdr build `0.9.0-preview.2026-09-08-62431dbd033b` exposes `terminal session observe` and `terminal session control` over NDJSON.
The browser renders its real ANSI screen frames using xterm, loaded only in Orchestration.
Observation does not claim ownership, resize the native runtime, or resume an agent.
Connect input explicitly claims the single native controller, which can resize the runtime and resume a pending agent; another controller is refused without takeover.
Keyboard input, one complete bracketed paste and native scrollback commands use that connection.
Shift+Escape releases input and restores keyboard access to its control; ordinary Escape stays with the connected agent.
Ctrl+Shift+C copies a selected terminal region.
Closing, switching, disconnecting or restarting invalidates the input lease; reconnection starts with observation and a full screen frame, never replayed input.
At most four native streams are open, writes have an eight-second cancellation bound, frame gaps disconnect, and oversized UTF-8 paste is rejected before sending.
Adjacent queued printable text coalesces into bounded ordered writes; control keys, paste wrappers, scroll and resize remain barriers, and custody is still checked for every native write.
Screen reader support is an explicit saved preference under Terminal options and changes in place without reconnecting.
The default xterm input mode accepts InsertText/IME Unicode; its optional screen-reader mode has an upstream InsertText limitation, while paste remains supported.
There is no second model session or generated reply.
The native interface exposes rendered screen updates rather than original historical PTY bytes, and omits Kitty keyboard negotiation, graphics and host mouse notifications.

CFO transport reads the operator-owned `state/primary.json` registration and binds each queued message to its fingerprint.
On Windows normal message delivery holds that registration against replacement and validates the live process/start time, foreground process group, registered agent, pane, workspace, tab and terminal ID before using a required-agent sender.
Missing or changed identity is refused, never passed to the explicit-pane shell fallback.
Herdr acceptance counters establish accepted delivery; the current native contract cannot prove a model response or provide an atomic process-identity compare-and-send operation.
Terminal input pins the exact terminal ID and task generation, checks current process ownership and pipeline custody before every write, and consumes ordered input identities once.
Writing native stdin does not acknowledge application acceptance.
Herdr cannot atomically compare the foreground process while writing: if an agent exits after the check, bytes may reach the same PowerShell terminal.
Known exited/replaced sessions are refused, but the board does not claim to eliminate that native check-then-write race.

Workspace details read only declared project/provisioning metadata and configured MCP names.
Configured is not connected; one shared note explains unavailable live connection and environment evidence.
Matching-generation native model evidence takes precedence; otherwise the model is explicitly labeled configured, including a configured default.
Environment values, full process environments, dotenv, auth scripts, MCP commands and headers are never exposed.

## Deliberate CFO questions

Worker `cfo notify --blocked` records and natural-language questions do not automatically become user modals.
The registered CFO must deliberately publish a decision from its own process ancestry:

```powershell
cfo question --id layout-choice-001 --text "Which layout should I use?" --option "Compact" --option "Spacious" --option "Keep current" --recommend "Spacious"
```

Omit `--option` when the question needs a written answer.
`--recommend` must exactly match a supplied option, which the modal shows first with its real recommendation; omit the flag when no option is recommended.
The Supreme Overlord Command Center labels supplied choices A/B/C and always offers Other for a written answer.
No choice is preselected and written text is sent only when Other is selected.
Use a new stable ID for a new question, and keep the same ID/content for an uncertain publication retry.
The publisher walks up to 32 process ancestors and verifies the registered CFO PID, creation time and live native identity; a worker cannot escalate on the CFO's behalf.
The UI serializes questions, preserves drafts through reconnects, and supports Escape/Later plus Command Center to revisit.
Once submitted, every tab displays the durable answer rather than an unsent local draft.
Answers retain their question and CFO identity and enter the durable native CFO message queue, never a worker send or gate approval.
Claude Code, Codex and Pi primary-context guidance routes explicit user decisions through this command.
Publish from the same registered primary shell, continue independent work or finish the turn awaiting the reply, and do not also open a native prompt tool: a normal message cannot answer a correlated native Codex/Pi prompt.
Duplicate HTTP/SSE outcomes cannot cause a second delivery; interrupted delivery becomes uncertain.
A replaced CFO's pending questions become superseded instead of reopening unanswerable modals.
The store bounds question history at 128 records, retires answered/superseded history, and defers overflow when all questions remain unresolved.
The bounded publication inbox is admitted in timestamp order, not hash-filename order, and rollover keeps its cutoff below the incoming timestamp so deferred and same-time questions are not discarded.
Conflicting, corrupt or oversized inbox records leave bounded diagnostics and cannot stop unrelated native events.

## Nonblocking presentation notices

After a presentation tool succeeds, its registered native owner may report the returned safe URL explicitly:

```powershell
cfo present --id browser-walkthrough-001 --task task-id --generation current-spawn-gen --kind browser --url http://127.0.0.1:5173/ --ttl 5m
```

Use `--kind review` for a review surface, and omit task/generation only from the verified primary CFO's own process ancestry.
For Lavish, use `lavish-axi <file> --no-open`, then report the actual successful session URL; do not republish a user-ended session.
Refresh the same ID only while the activity remains live, and report `--state ended` with the same identity/URL on completion.
IDs cannot change recipient or URL, and an ended pending record cannot be reopened by a later refresh.
The store and inbox retain at most 128 receipts, URLs exclude credentials/query/fragment and known sensitive paths, and expiry is limited to thirty minutes.
Only declared safe presentation links belong here, not raw tool arguments or arbitrary browser history.
Task indicators require current generation and fresh runtime evidence; primary notices use their exact verified registration, checked on the existing supervisor cycle at most once per minute.
Command Center offers Open page/Open review and Keep in background without redirecting, opening a modal, controlling the native browser, or pausing work.
This is an explicit reporting integration, not interception of every browser tool or a live browser-mirroring stream.

## Local endpoint boundaries

The listener requires a numeric loopback address.
Host and Origin checks, cross-site rejection, a per-instance mutation token, strict request schemas, and bounded request bodies protect the local control API.
These are local browser boundaries, not authentication against another process already running as the same Windows user.
Git previews refuse unsafe revisions, traversal, symlinks/junctions, and common credential-bearing paths.
Git output, timeouts, cache entries, concurrent previews, and event streams are bounded.
Native terminal frames preserve the actual screen, including anything printed there; avoid displaying secrets in the terminal.
Input bytes and native frames are not logged or persisted by this bridge.
Per-page CSP nonces permit the terminal's generated stylesheets while inline scripts remain blocked.
The separate `style-src-attr 'unsafe-inline'` directive permits CSS style attributes across the page for xterm 6's ANSI truecolor rendering.
This is a page-wide CSS-attribute compatibility allowance; style elements still require the page nonce or a same-origin source, and script, connection and framing restrictions remain unchanged.

## Build and verification

Use Node 24.13.0 and the committed npm lockfile when editing the board:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
cd ..
go build -o cfo.exe ./cmd/cfo
```

Vite generates `internal/boardweb/dist`; do not edit that output manually.
Commit the regenerated assets with frontend source changes.
The HTML input and embedded HTML/JavaScript/CSS outputs are pinned to LF in `.gitattributes`, because Vite preserves template newlines and Git checkout conversion otherwise reports rebuilt assets as modified on Windows.
Both Windows CI and release workflows install from the lockfile, check the frontend, regenerate assets, and fail if the committed bundle differs before compiling Go.
The runtime executable embeds those assets and requires no Node process.
For frontend development, `npm run dev` listens at `127.0.0.1:5173` and proxies API calls to a supervisor on `127.0.0.1:4310`, translating only that explicit local development origin.

Before any test step invokes `cfo` or `go test`, clear `CFO_HOME` and `CFO_STATE_OVERRIDE` or point both to an isolated temporary home.
For bounded local checks, use `GOMAXPROCS=2`, `go vet -p 1 ./...`, and `go test -p 1 ./...`.
The opt-in `tests/acceptance/native_board_windows.ps1 -Binary <absolute-built-executable> -HarnessBinary <absolute-harness-executable>` requires `CFO_BOARD_REAL=1` and creates an isolated home, git project, named Herdr session, native CFO and worker processes, hooks, and board.
Build the harness from `./tests/fixtures/native-board-harness` with the basename `codex.exe`.
Validate/scan both supplied executables before running them when required by machine security policy; copying or rebuilding a flagged binary is not clearance.
The fixture's disposable `codex.exe` is a deterministic test process, not Codex and not a model invocation; its basename exercises Herdr's real foreground-process contract.
Only the recorded fixture PIDs/session may be stopped during crash checks.
The fixture uses `serve --example`, allowed only with a temporary CFO home and its own state directory.
That mode labels Example workspace and omits the production machine-wide orphan inventory, which otherwise sees unrelated host processes beside the isolated Herdr session.
It retains task monitoring and custody checks and never clears shared decisions or stops shared processes.
See [the implementation evidence](evidence/cfo-native-board.md) for measured overhead, browser results, and the unresolved earlier Defender detections.

## Source provenance

Native contracts were checked against installed versions and the primary [Codex hooks](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/hooks), [Claude Code hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks), and [Pi extensions](https://pi.dev/docs/latest/extensions) documentation.
The pinned [Cline Kanban source](https://github.com/cline/kanban/tree/abd4912c27ce6b7f18b5a8106c145fd838e90cc4) supplied adapted board, diff, history, and runtime-stream behavior.
Its Apache-2.0 license, copyright, file links, and modification notes are retained in `frontend/public/assets/NOTICE.txt` and the bundled license files; no upstream NOTICE file was present at that revision.
SIQshift's shared brand stylesheet, desktop/web controls, and shared ShiftGroups supplied inspected card/ghost/focus, native-select and disclosure primitives.
The user-approved generated mockups supplied the final dark/mint two-view composition, large system typography and terminal-goblin artwork.
The supplied code/workflow references informed review and lineage presentation without adding a graph dependency or an automation editor.
